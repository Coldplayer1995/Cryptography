# Cryptography
#### This project is focused on Cryptography and will contain code snippets and description about different Algorithms, Mode of Operations, etc

Encryption Algorithms:

1.Symmetric Key Encryption — In symmetric key algorithms, there is one common key, used to lock and unlock the encryption “box.” Both the sender and the receiver have the same key. Symmetric key algorithms are very fast because keys do not need to be very long; however, there exists the problem of sharing the common key in the first place as it could be intercepted and then the entire system is compromised.
2.Asymmetric Key Encryption — In asymmetric key algorithms, only the receiver holds the key. The receiver can publicly send out a lock (or method of locking our hypothetical box), for which only the receiver holds the key. The lock is called the public key, and the key is called the private key. Note: There is only one public key for each private key.
